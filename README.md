# go-collections

A library which has implementations of most of the DS.
This started as an education project and will later decide if
can be used for something else.

Mainting devlogs so that I can blog about it, the more I write I will remember more I guess !

**Since this is an educational project, right now all operations will be on numerical numbers, no Generics at this time**

### DevLog:


1. [LinkedList](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list) 
    - ArrayList -> Backed by an array which gives Random Access for O(1) access
    - LinkedList -> Backed by `Node` type data structure which provides faster Add/Remove operations
